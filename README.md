### Team: Wit-AI-lab 
#### Members: Yuanzhi Wang, Tao Lu, Yanduo Zhang, Yuntao Wu

It contains the codes to attend NTIRE 2021: Depth-Guided Image Relighting Challenge Track 1: One-to-one relighting

## Prerequisites
- Linux (Ubuntu 1604 or Windows 10)
- Anaconda
- Python 3.7
- NVIDIA RTX2080Ti GPU (11G memory or larger) + CUDA10.2 + cuDNN
- PyTorch1.5.0 
- dominate
- kornia 0.2.0
- lpips-pytorch

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Create a conda virtual environment
```bash
conda create -n MCN python=3.7
```
- Install PyTorch
```bash
conda install pytorch==1.5.1 torchvision==0.6.1 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
```
- Install dominate
```bash
pip install dominate
```
- Install kornia
```bash
pip install kornia==0.2.0
```
- Install lpips-pytorch
```bash 
pip install git+https://github.com/S-aiueo32/lpips-pytorch.git
```
### Testing
- All test images are included in the `./dataset/NTIRE2021_TEST/test` folder.
- The model for testing is placed in `./checkpoints/best_model/latest_net_G.pth`
- Test the model:
```bash
python test.py
```
The test results will be saved to the folder: `./output`.
