## Getting Started
### Installation
- Create a conda virtual environment
```bash
conda create -n MCN python=3.7
```
- Install PyTorch
```bash
conda install pytorch==1.5.1 torchvision==0.6.1 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
```
- Install dominate
```bash
pip install dominate
```
- Install kornia
```bash
pip install kornia==0.2.0
```
- Install lpips-pytorch
```bash 
pip install git+https://github.com/S-aiueo32/lpips-pytorch.git
```

### Testing
- Two test images are included in the `./dataset/NTIRE2021_TEST/test`
- Please place the pre-trained model in `./checkpoints/best_model/latest_net_G.pth`
- Test the model:
```bash
python test.py
```
The test results will be saved to the folder: `./output`.

### Training
The training code will be released soon
